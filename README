README

This is a git webhook client in rust. It can be used to deploy your application automatically or anything you'd like to run after a commit.

FEATURES

- listens on /hook/ port 5000 for http requests
- matches project name against configured project in config.json
- runs the corresponding command and arguments as configured in config.json
- dumps the result of this run in console, including stderr, stdout
- can send the result of the the run on slack
- allow at most one deploy per application at the same time: if there are two commits arriving at the same time, the second one will be put on hold until the first deploy has completed. Also, if two commits arrive during a deploy, the deployer will only deploy one more time, not twice.
